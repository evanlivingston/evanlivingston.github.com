Most discussions about the explosion or impolosion or whatever it may be of the ‘Social Media Bubble’ address the financial side of Social Media. The potential shrinking of Social Media opportunity space is not what were interested in here. Instead let us focus on the loss of interest of massive Social Media services that occupy the internet today.

To our generation digital personalities seem like a given. I have My computer with My files on it. This machine is something I own, something I alone change and manipulate, and thus an extension of personality. Not only is my computer a part of my identity or a reflection of my identity, I exist online as well. Recently we have witnessed the merging or flattening of these personalties into one. What has been called Web 2.0 allows us to collect and link these personalties into one-each social media host vying to be the top profile under whch the others are merged. But where did this notion emerge? All previous forms of media, all other sources of news have lacked the user-centric perspective that the internet seems to offer so naturally.

We can find traces identity in the timesharing systems of the 60’s and 70’s. In these systems a computer could be accessed by multiple people and used for different purposes concurrently. For reasons of security it was natural to create an analogy for the user whithin the system. If we want to look for the earliest form of online communication we should look no further than time-sharing systems. They were capable of sending what we call email or instant messages to other users of the system.

Nearly synonmyous with the internet is the idea of personal communication using computers. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) dates back to 1988. The world of IRC can still seem daunting to newcomer, but it’s one of older and more vetted form of social communication online. IRC is interesting because it shows the formation of online communities clearly. IRC defines a protocol which can be followed and implemnted by anyone. More specifically, anyone who has the desire, can engage in the world of IRC. While IRC shows us early examples of online communities, it was and is used primarily by person who are highly computer literate. It is not until 1994 with the birth of Geocities that we find the internet opening itself up to the average citizens of the world.

blah blah blah

People want fast access to online identity formation people are easily entertained by quick amusement

This is not a highpoint of entertainment Social media will attempt to to precisely define the types of interactions peopel can have
