<p>I use to work in restaurants. I worked really hard, in places across the U.S. and Europe like <a href="http://www.greenzebrachicago.com/">Green Zebra</a>, <a href="http://www.relaischateaux.com/bottaccio#">Il Bottaccio</a>, <a href="http://www.indewulf.be/?lang=en">In De Wulf</a> and <a href="http://www.thecakebreadranch.com/">The Cakebread Ranch</a>. I can't believe how much I learnedâ€”but I always felt like something was missing. </p>
<p>I'm currently exploring ways of using food to approach issues of social justice and connect with others. As a cook I'm specifically drawn to how dining and food preparation, both inside and outside our homes, intersects with issues of health and equality. </p>

<p>In 2015 I took a position teaching middle schoolers in public schools about food and how to cook it. Here is our <a href="http://haywardcooks.tumblr.com/">blog</a>.</p>
