<p>I'm eight years into my adult life and food seems to be a recurring theme. However, I no longer want to spend all my time working in restaurants. Instead I want to use my skills and knowledge 
to meaningfully contribute to the health and happiness of others by impacting lives.</p>

<p>In 2015 I took a position teaching middle schoolers in public schools about food and how to cook it. Here is our <a href="http://haywardcooks.tumblr.com/">blog</a>.</p>
