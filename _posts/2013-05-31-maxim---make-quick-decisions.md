I recently noticed that I am often trepidatious when it comes to making decisions. These decisions range from “Where should I go out to dinner” to “What week should I fly to Indiana”. In a sense, it’s a sort of procrastination, putting off making a decision until it is absolutely necessary. While a decision is almost always reached, there is a lot of wasted time, spent energy and worry that precipitates these decisions. So in an attempt to stamp out and avoid these negative accompaniments of decision making I have decided to just make decisions!

It’s important to realize that most of the decisions I make arbitrary. I doesn’t really matter where I go out for dinner. If I go to Indiana this week or next week is largely unimportant. What is important is that I tear through decisions so that they stop lurking in the back of my mind, and free up space to focus on issues that actually matter.

In a sense, I think the lack of commitment to decision making is a precursor to procrastination, not a symptom. Sure, I could tell myself to finish the voter registration that’s been on my desk for two weeks, but then I would have to tell myself to do it. With procrastinators like myself it is not enough to simply ‘do it’, triage assault carpe diem style. No, that’s still a chore that can be put off for later. However, if I make a decision about the voter registration, then any activity that follows isn’t really part of the chores I’m trying desperately to avoid, but instead is the self-willed following through of a decision that I made. It gives me ownership over the task at hand, which I need.

So I’m going to start making more quick decisions.
