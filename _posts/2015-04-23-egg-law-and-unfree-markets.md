I’ve been enjoying the past week and half staying on my mother’s farm out in the country. The farm that my mother and stepfather have so lovingly created and continue to create is a throwback to pre industrial revolution style farms. I don’t mean that in a sense of appearance but rather function. The farm is not one meant to generate as much profit as possible by producing as much cash crop as possible but instead is meant to provide sustenance for those working the land and ideally provide a small amount of income for things that cannot be grown or made locally.

My Stepfather originally experimented with keeping chickens both for their eggs and for slaughter. After creating his first chicken coup from reclaimed materials and filling it with young chicks he seemingly fell in love with chickens. There are now four chicken coups separating the different generations and different local breeds of chickens, each one surrounded with an enormous movable fence. The coups are moved frequently in keeping with permaculture techniques so that no one plot of land becomes exhausted. Sometimes you can go out to the fields and see him talking to his chickens. My mother won’t let me annoy or terrorize the chickens at all, she wants "happy, peaceful" chickens she says. He has since found that at market cut flowers deliver more net profit and has expanded his flower plots. The eggs and chickens however remain an important part of his income. As you drive through the country you can see the signs for fresh eggs as you approach the house. There’s a refrigerator on the porch full of cartons and a wooden box above for money so that people may purchase eggs even when no one is home. This is the kind of trust often found in small rural communities. 

There are three farmers' markets in the Ohio valley where my stepfather sells his produce, dairy and flowers. He’s apparently be ducking the Ohio health inspector for awhile now, and this morning he received the call from that he can no longer sell eggs without 1) a $250 (annual) permit and 2) Refrigeration at market.

First, I’d like the point out that the [regulations and treatment of eggs and chickens in the U.S. are absolutely bat-shit](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nadiaarumugam/2012/10/25/why-american-eggs-would-be-illegal-in-a-british-supermarket-and-vice-versa/3/). In short, it is illegal to wash or refrigerate eggs in England and they have around 500 cases of salmonella poisoning each year, whereas in the U.S. we have around 142,000 cases of poisoning.

Secondly, a \$250 permit? Why? I’m interested in understanding how to better find the origin of these kinds of laws and regulations. The pessimist in me believes it’s a regulation enacted by a group of dairy experts, likely from lobbying and it’s intended to favor larger vendors for whom $250 is trivial.

This brings me to my real point. In the Midwest, and in my hometown in Indiana (of 40,000 people) which is now seemingly beyond decline, but simply dead, there’s a discreet lack of freedom of choice. The choices only appear to be dwindling as time goes on. Food choices are one of the clearest examples of the vanishing choices. Local restaurants continue to close as chain restaurants continue to open. After more than five years cooking in American and European restaurants, I’ve come to understand American restaurant chains as variations on a theme (Starbucks is really just a dressed up Dairy Queen). Furthermore, nearly all of these restaurants, including the locally owned ones source their food from Sysco, who in turns distributes primarily Tyson and Cargill foods. There exists only one locally owned grocery store in this town, and it’s more akin to a novelty store selling mostly old-timey candy and hard to find sodas. The fact is; if you buy groceries here you buy them from Kroger (Fred Meyer), Walmart, or Marsh. These stores all have severely limited selections of produce; Mexican hothouse tomatoes are the only tomatoes. Tyson, Smithfield and Cargill are the [only meats available](http://www.foodcircles.missouri.edu/CRJanuary02.pdf). Kraft cheese and Coca Cola and Pepsi products rule the shelves. Even more confusing is when you walk into anyone of these stores and the shelves seem to stretch on to infinity. It doesn’t feel or look like a lack of choice, but isn't it? 

Most interesting is that when you try to deviate from this predominating model of exchange you immediately run up against legislation directing you back into the model. Want to buy some local eggs, not produced in an egg factory, but lovingly produced? If you’re lucky you’ll be able to find a farmer who spent most of his life as a CPA and has the money to pay for mobile refrigeration and $250 licenses. Food vending permits are prohibitively expensive to small producers and growers here in the U.S. which drastically limits the potential variety within regional food system. As Pingali, Khwaja and Meijer [point out](http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnado609.pdf#page=68):

Which has more variety?

This?

I honestly can’t answer the question. Variety exists beyond and below the surface. Quantity and color don’t translate directly into variety as we are lead to believe as consumers. A variety of brands doesn't indicate true variety. There is an ongoing [consolidation](http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/academic/agec619/PP/IO_mats/Rogers%202001.pdf) of brands into larger corporations. More importantly there is ongoing consolidation and standardization of agricultural inputs used by those increasingly consolidate brands.

I recall reading a story about the black market of food in Cuba—an example of how communism so severely limits the choices of food that a black market arises to meet the demand of consumers. But, then I recall the numerous occasions when I’ve purchased foodstuffs and libations on the “black market” in the U.S. Bathtub moonshine, Milk from a neighbor, honey from a friend, marijuana stolen from a grower, duck liver in Chicago, Potatoes, rhubarb and mushrooms from a farmer coming through the backdoor in a restaurant.

I don’t mean to assert abundance of choice and selection as an imperative or a sort of goal. Rather, I’d like to point out the mechanism of fabricated freedom of choice—the assertion that profuseness is a value and that we have it here the U.S. and the hyperreality that this assertion helps create. Furthermore there feels to be a systematic dismantling of the mechanisms that allow space to produce and consume as free agents and increasing enrollment into the growing corporatocracy dominating the food landscape.
