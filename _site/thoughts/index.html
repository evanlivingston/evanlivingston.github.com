       <blockquote>
  <p>Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.
But since you must kill to eat, and rob the newly born of its mother’s milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship.
And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still more innocent in man.</p>

       <p>There is a growing trend to portray the act of cooking as an art. Food journalism is increasingly focused on the appearance of food, photographing our food is the norm and the newest cookbooks look more like coffee table art books more than collections of recipes. Eating engages most—usually and hopefully all—of our senses and thus is a necessarily aesthetic experience. As cooking continues to evolve and develop it follows that we would want to maximize the effect cooking has on our senses and expand the pleasure of eating. But do we lose something when we prioritize the pleasure of eating? Is it possible we’re distancing ourselves from a simpler joy of cooking?</p>

       <p>I’ve been enjoying the past week and half staying on my mother’s farm out in the country. The farm that my mother and stepfather have so lovingly created and continue to create is a throwback to pre industrial revolution style farms. I don’t mean that in a sense of appearance but rather function. The farm is not one meant to generate as much profit as possible by producing as much cash crop as possible but instead is meant to provide sustenance for those working the land and ideally provide a small amount of income for things that cannot be grown or made locally.</p>
